Solo Leveling: Arise is a highly anticipated action RPG game based on the popular manhwa series of the same name. The game, developed by Netmarble, is set to launch globally on May 8, 2024, for PC and mobile platforms[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/).

The game follows the journey of Sung Jin-Woo, the main protagonist from the Solo Leveling manhwa, as he rises from being the weakest hunter to becoming the world's strongest[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/). Players will explore various worlds, tackle challenging gates, and engage in fast-paced combat against a range of enemies alongside their Raid Party[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/).

One of the most impressive aspects of Solo Leveling: Arise is the sheer number of pre-registrations it has generated. As of April 2024, the game has surged to over 12 million pre-registrations, showcasing the immense popularity of the franchise[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/). Pre-registration rewards include a Chic Black Suit Costume for Sung Jin-Woo, Mana Power Crystals, Legendary Artifact sets, 100,000 Gold, and a bonus reward of Yoo Jinho, Jin-Woo's hunter partner[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/).

The game's release comes shortly after the successful anime adaptation of Solo Leveling, which aired in 2024 and received critical acclaim[\[1\]](https://www.creepykingdom.com/post/solo-leveling-season-1-review)[\[3\]](https://www.gamesradar.com/solo-leveling-season-2-trailer-announcement/). The anime currently holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, further solidifying the franchise's popularity[\[3\]](https://www.gamesradar.com/solo-leveling-season-2-trailer-announcement/).

In terms of gameplay, Solo Leveling: Arise incorporates typical gacha features found in games like Genshin Impact[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/). Players will be able to collect and team up with different hunters from the series, earn various items and weapons, and learn new skills and abilities[\[2\]](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/solo-leveling-arise-2624724/).

While some fans are excited about the game's release, others have expressed concerns about Netmarble's reputation as a greedy company that focuses on money-grabbing tactics[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/sololeveling/comments/1asa9h5/solo_leveling_arise_whats_your_thoughts_on_the/). However, it's worth noting that Netmarble's games are generally considered playable, even for free-to-play players[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/sololeveling/comments/1asa9h5/solo_leveling_arise_whats_your_thoughts_on_the/).

Overall, Solo Leveling: Arise is poised to be a major success, riding on the coattails of the anime adaptation's popularity and the franchise's dedicated fanbase. The game's impressive pre-registration numbers and the timing of its release, shortly after the anime's "Arise" episode, suggest that Netmarble is strategically capitalizing on the hype surrounding the series[\[3\]](https://www.gamesradar.com/solo-leveling-season-2-trailer-announcement/)[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/sololeveling/comments/1asa9h5/solo_leveling_arise_whats_your_thoughts_on_the/).
